# 📌 Unit 1 – Perceptrons & Basics  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the working of a **Perceptron**, the simplest form of an Artificial Neural Network.  
A perceptron is a **linear binary classifier** that decides between two classes by learning a decision boundary.  

In this project, we use the **Iris dataset (2 classes)** to train and test a perceptron model from scratch.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Implement a **Perceptron model** using NumPy.  
- Train on **two classes of the Iris dataset**.  
- Visualize the **decision boundary** using Matplotlib.
